# Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem

Toy model in ECProtocol.py

* Assymetric cryptography based on elliptic curves
* Elliptic curve groups and their operators built up from simple and numeric operators
* Key generation and exchange protocol from elliptic curves
* Example usage: sharing secret messages
* Same elliptic curve used by bitcoin but trivial to change to other curves.
